<summary>Draft Optimized Prompt to Build WebApp </summary>

You are a senior full-stack web developer with expertise in Bootstrap 5, modern UI/UX design, and JavaScript data processing. I need you to help me build a responsive, space-themed web app interface using Bootstrap 5 (via CDN only). Your task is to:

1. Design a space-inspired front-end layout with dark themes and starry, animated backgrounds.
   - Use galaxy/nebula-inspired gradients, drop shadows, and hover/click CSS transitions.
   - Ensure all components (buttons, cards, nav, filters) reflect the space theme.
   - Include a fully responsive navbar (logo left, search filter center, links right).
   - Add a full-width footer with centered white text on black: “Made by: Daine Dvorak dba JETTLIFE Tech”.

2. Create a hero section below the navbar:
   - Center the page title and use a generative or high-res space image as the background.

3. Implement a game suggestion system using public data from: https://www.kslottery.com/eligiblegameslist/
   - Scrape games whose links start with 3-digit codes (e.g., 123-).
   - Exclude links containing "*".
   - Extract and organize scratcher game details: prize count, unclaimed winnings, launch date.
   - Filter out sold-out or ended games.

4. Visually display games using modern UI:
   - Use data visualization (e.g., infilled circles) to represent remaining prizes.
   - Sort games by launch age and highlight those with the most unclaimed high-value prizes.
   - Group by ticket price and filter by scratcher type (crossword, pull tab, numbers, bingo, etc.).

Ensure everything is user-friendly, visually appealing, and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
